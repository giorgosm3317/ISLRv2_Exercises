# Introduction to Statistical Learning 2 - Exercise Attempts

There are my attempts to solve the exercises from the second version of the "Introduction to Statistical Learning" book by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (2021).

The pdf of the book is available online for free at: https://www.statlearning.com/

Wherever it is possible, I will try to provide solutions by adopting the tiydverse package.

Everyone is welcome to create new issues or discuss their own proposed solutions at the discussions section.

Work In Progress --> still studying the book.
